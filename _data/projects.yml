- project: "Baraff-Witkin Cloth Model with IPC Collision Handling"
  role: Personal Project
  duration: Oct, 2024
  description: "
    An implementation of the Baraff-Witkon cloth model. Unlike the original solver, our solver is based on a variational (optimization) formulation of the cloth model,
    and we solve this optimization problem using Newton's method. The IPC (Incremental Potential Contact) algorithm is used to handle the collision between the cloth and the rigid body.

- project: "Meshy - A 3D AIGC Project"
  role: Participant
  duration: Oct, 2023
  description: "
      Participating in the <a href='https://www.meshy.ai/'> Meshy </a> project as a graphics R&D engineer. Meshy is a 3D AIGC project that aims to generate 3D models from the text or image prompt. 
      My responsibilities include optimizing the generateion quality and performance of the 3D generative model, and investigating various differentiable geometric representations, etc.

- project: "Classical Partial Differential Equations: Numerical and Exact Solutions"
  role: Personal Project
  duration: May, 2023
  description: "
    Several classical linear partial differential equations, including the transport equation, Laplace's equation, the heat equation, and the wave equation, are analyzed. 
    Their exact solutions and numerical solutions (including Eulerian methods and Monte Carlo methods) in two-dimensional space are then compared.

- project: A Corrected Derivation of Invertible Neo-Hookean Model
  role: Personal Project
  duration: May, 2023
  description: "
    In this project, we implement several different invertible constitutive models. 
    Additionally, we correct the derivation of the invertible neo-hookean model, which is presented in the SIGGRAPH course 'Dynamic Deformables: Implementation and Production Practicalities'.

- project: 2D Semi-Implicit MPM
  role: Personal Project
  duration: May, 2023
  description: "
    We provide a detailed derivation of a 2D semi-implicit MPM (Material Point Method) time integration solver, and the experimental results are analyzed.
    Unlike other matrix-free methods (such as PCG), which avoid the explicit construction of stiffness matrices, we provide a full derivation for a 2D semi-implicit method and present the explicit form of the stiffness matrix.

- project: High-Performance PBD Physics Engine
  role: Company Project
  duration: Aug, 2021
  description: "
                This project aims to develop a high-performance PBD (position-based dynamics) physics engine, which is similar to Houdini Vellum. The engine supports a series of materials' simulation: rigid body, soft body, fluid, cloth, granular material, etc. 
                We achieve <a href='https://twitter.com/TaichiGraphics/status/1537193238632599552'>a 60 FPS's 240k particles fluid simulation</a>, and the simulation can be extended to <a href='https://twitter.com/taichi_lang/status/1593148740105568256'>a large-scale scene</a> (there are 20 million particles in the picture on the right side).
                To obtain a high-quality fluid surface, we implement a surface reconstruction algorithm based on dual contouring.
                In this project, we also use a CCD (Continuous collision detection) algorithm to tackle the tricky collision problem.
