- project: Soft2D Physics Engine
  role: Company Project
  duration: May, 2023
  description: "
                <a href='https://www.soft2d.tech/'>Soft2D</a> is a 2D multi-material continuum physics engine designed for real-time applications. 
                With soft2d, users can simulate various materials such as fluids, sand, snow, and elastic bodies within their applications. Soft2D runs on GPU, and currently supports Vulkan and Metal backends.
                For user convenience, we offer a comprehensive suite of easy-to-use interfaces in C language. Please see the <a href='https://docs.soft2d.tech/'>user documentation</a> for more details. 
                We also provide a free-to-access unity plugin - <a href='https://github.com/taichi-dev/soft2d-for-unity'>Soft2D for Unity</a>, which allows users to build simulation scenes in a low-code way.

- project: High-Performance PBD Physics Engine
  role: Company Project
  duration: Aug, 2021
  description: "
                This project aims to develop a high-performance PBD (position-based dynamics) physics engine, which is similar to Houdini Vellum. The engine supports a series of materials' simulation: rigid body, soft body, fluid, cloth, granular material, etc. 
                We achieve <a href='https://twitter.com/TaichiGraphics/status/1537193238632599552'>a 60 FPS's 240k particles fluid simulation</a>, and the simulation can be extended to <a href='https://twitter.com/taichi_lang/status/1593148740105568256'>a large-scale scene</a> (there are 20 million particles in the picture on the right side).
                To obtain a high-quality fluid surface, we implement a surface reconstruction algorithm based on dual contouring.
                In this project, we also use a CCD (Continuous collision detection) algorithm to tackle the tricky collision problem.
