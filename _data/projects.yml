- project: GAMES 201 Course Projects
  role: Personal Project
  duration: June, 2020
  description: "
                This project includes implementations of Course <a href='https://forum.taichi.graphics/'> GAMES 201: 高级物理引擎实战指南2020 </a>.
                I implement almost all algorithms mentioned in this course, these algorithms include:
                Euler fluid methods; Hybrid fluid methods: PIC (Particle-In-Cell), APIC (Affine Particle-In-Cell), FLIP (Fluid Implicit Particles), MPM (Material Point Method); 3D implicit FEM (Finite Element Method); Vortex methods;
                Several numerical methods: Conjugate Gradients, Multigrid Methods. All procedurals are implemented in Taichi Programming Language.
                See Code link for more details.

- project: Real-Time Fluid Simulation In Games
  role: Personal Project (Advisor &colon; Xiaosheng Li)
  duration: Jul, 2019  &mdash; Sep, 2019
  description: "
                This pre-research project was finished during my internship in NetEase Games, with advisor <a href='https://www.linkedin.com/in/xiaosheng-li-54aa0484/?originalSubdomain=cn'>Xiaosheng Li </a>.
                This project aims to explore the possibility of achieving real-time interactive fluid simulations in desktop and mobile games.
                Two popular Lagrangian methods, SPH (Smooth Particles Hydrodynamics) and PBF (Position Based Fluids), are implemented on both PC and cell phones, and their performance are compared.
                For free-surface rendering, two methods are implemented and compared: Marching Cubes and SSFR (Screen Space Fluid Rendering). 
                This project is implemented by Unity Compute Shader and fully runs on GPU. See Slides link for more details.

- project: Vascular Fitting System
  role: Personal Project
  duration: 2017
  url: "https://yucrazing.github.io/2018/06/01/Vascular-Fitting-System-Based-on-Ball-B-Spline-Curves.html"
  description: "
                A vascular fitting system for visualizing, editing and fitting 3D vascular data.
                This software is developed during my first year of graduate, and it is currently used by Virtual Reality and Visualization Lab of Beijing Normal University.
                This system is mainly based on Dynamic Ball B-Spline Curves and is implemented by Qt / C++ / OpenGL.

- project: Computer Graphics Course Assistant
  role: Personal Project
  duration: 2017
  description: "
                  Design a series of assignments for Beijing Normal University undergraduate computer graphics course.
                  The content of the assignments includes: Modern OpenGL tutorial, Basic shading modes, Mesh subdivision, Curves and surfaces, Physical simulation and Simple ray tracing.
                  These procedures are based on Qt C++ framework and use the OpenGL 4.0 APIs.
